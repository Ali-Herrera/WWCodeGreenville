## **Chapter 1: The Enigmatic Endpoint**
In the bustling headquarters of DevTech Inc., where code flowed like a digital river not unlike the lovely Reedy River of downtown Greenville, a QA engineer named Sam stumbled upon an unusual API endpoint while creating a new automated test suite. The endpoint, "/api/goblin," was buried deep within the company's vast codebase, and yet was not part of the Swagger spec or any other documentation. Curiosity piqued, so Sam decided to call the endpoint to see what she could gather.  She received a baffling JSON response:

```
{
  "goblins": [
    {
      "name": "Grumble",
      "quirk": "Only speaks in riddles",
      "request": "Send me a list of prime numbers in binary."
    },
    {
      "name": "Squeak",
      "quirk": "Hides in nested arrays",
      "request": "Find me a Fibonacci sequence in reverse."
    }
  ]
}
```

The response contained a list of peculiar goblins, each with its own quirk and their own bizarre API request. 

### What does Sam decide to do next?
- If Sam chuckles at the absurdity of it all and decides to play along by making a request to the first goblin, move to [Chapter 2](Chapter2.md).
- If Sam ignores these responses and goes about her day, move to [Chapter 3](Chapter3.md).
