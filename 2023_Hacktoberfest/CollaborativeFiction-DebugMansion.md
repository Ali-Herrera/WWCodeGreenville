# The Haunting of Debug Mansion: Where Ghosts Prefer Zero Errors - A Collaborative Story
## A Women Who Code Greenville Collaborative Fiction Experiment
_This story was started by Jen Bauer with the help of AI in the form of ChatGPT and Claude, then adjusted further and given additional detail through magic, imagination, and Markdown._

Additional authors who added to this story are:
- TBD, looking forward to seeing who jumps in!


#### *A few quick thoughts on this project before you jump in:*
- The Issues in the repository will outline how to add to this story and help set the pace, but the basic idea is as follows:
    - This is considered a "round robin" collaborative story approach, where chapters are added linearly one after the other.
    - Therefore, there is only one file to update - this one!  However, you are welcome to create subsections to chapters, use formatting, or otherwise add in additional content as you like to help tell your part of the story.
    - Feel free to take your time adding to the story as you like.  Issues will be create one after another as chapters are completed.
- Improvisational comedy has the concept of "yes and", which is the idea of keeping yourself open to new situations in the moment so that a scene can grow and keep being interesting.  Keep your options open!  See where you can go next, and leave opportunities for your characters and the situation to go in different directions.
- The prime directive above all is to have fun with this project. :D


## **Chapter 1: A Surprising Inheritance**
Vanessa peers through fog.  It's cold.  It's summer, but it's always cold, somehow.  Uncle Bernie was like, that to.

When he passed, I was the sole inheritor, somehow.  I thought this was a gift, getting a quiet place to launch my startup just landing in my lap. 

I was wrong.  I had no idea what I was walking into.

The long drive through the misty bog to get to the imposing iron gates should have been my first clue that this was no ordinary home. As soon as I set foot inside the towering Victorian manor, I could hear strange glitching noises and eerie voices echoing down the stone halls.

I was exploring the grand foyer of the mansion, gazing up at the intricate carvings and moth-eaten tapestries, when a shriek echoed from the rickety winding staircase. I spun around to see a ghostly figure materialize, glowing with a soft light, wearing chunky glasses and an oversized plaid button-down and jeans - 80s programmer garb. Tiny ones and zeros flickered around her translucent form. She had a laptop tucked under one arm that glitched and sparked erratically.

"Hello!" she greeted cheerfully. "You must be Vanessa. I'm Clara."

I stammered, struggling to form words in the presence of an actual ghost.  But... a nerdy ghost?  What?  Clara continued breezily as if nothing was out of the ordinary.  She had an assuredness that I enjoyed, despite being terrified a few moments earlier.  At least someone here was not uncomfortable as they were.

She explained how Uncle Bernie was not just an eccentric, but in fact an eccentric programming genius. "He fully integrated code into the very walls of this place," she remarked, tapping the peeling wallpaper that rippled in response with a cascade of binary symbols at her touch.

"So...this place is haunted by programs?" I asked hesitantly. 

"By programmers!" Clara corrected. "Bernie's old coding partners. Their spirits got trapped trying to debug all of Bernie's systems. They're determined to fix every last bug, so they can finally rest in peace.  Including, well, me.  I have a pull request open now, in fact."

I stared, dumbfounded. Clara just smiled patiently. This was going to take some getting used to. But if I was going to get any work done here, it looked like I had no choice but to debug this haunted mansion and its eternal coders.
